/**
 * ClusteringColumn is the family column in legacy Cassandra API
 *
 * <p>The purpose of this column is have additional dimension in the table. Both @PartitionKey
 * and @ClusteringColumn together are parts of the primary key of the table. The primary difference
 * between them is that the first one is using for routing purposes in order to locate a data node
 * in the cluster, otherwise the second one is using inside the node to locate peace of data in
 * concrete machine.
 *
 * <p>ClusteringColumn can be represented as a Key in SortedMap that fully stored in a single node.
 * All developers must be careful for selecting fields for clustering columns, because all data
 * inside this SortedMap must fit in to one node.
 *
 * <p>ClusteringColumn can have more than one part and the order of parts is important. This order
 * defines the way how Cassandra joins the parts and influence of data retrieval operations. Each
 * part can have ordering property that defines default ascending or descending order of data. In
 * case of two and more parts in select queries developer needs to have consisdent order of all
 * parts as they defined in table.
 *
 * <p>For example, first part is ASC ordering, second is also ASC, so Cassandra will sort entries
 * like this: a-a a-b b-a b-b In this case we are able run queries: ORDER BY first ASC, second ASC
 * ORDER BY first DESC, second DESC WHERE first=? ORDER BY second ASC WHERE first=? ORDER BY second
 * DESC WHERE first=? AND second=?
 *
 * <p>But, we can not run queries: ORDER BY first DESC, second ASC ORDER BY first ASC, second DESC
 * WHERE second=? ORDER BY first (ASC,DESC)
